Once upon a time, near a village lived some animals. A hare, who was very proud of her abilities,
 used to live there with her friends, who used to gossip all day...
 A hardworking tortoise used to work everyday but still he used to be teased by everyone for being so slow.
 One day, the hare and her friends met the tortoise and started to tease him, the tortoise got angry and said that he can win a 
 race from that evil hare.
